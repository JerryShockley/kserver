## Kserver

This is an incomplete prototype I began working on for a small startup company in Mountain View, CA called Kokko, Inc. The company changed direction and no longer wanted to pursue their concept of a beauty portal. This is a Ruby on Rails project. I've received permission to place this into the public domain.
