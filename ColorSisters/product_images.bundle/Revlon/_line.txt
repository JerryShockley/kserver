I believe in only buying the best, because I'm worth it. There is no better foundation than Dior.  Yeah, it costs a bundle but I love how it creates an irridescent glow to my skin.

I have tried <i>so</i> many different foundation products over the years, but most make my skin
break out. Dior is the only makeup I can wear every day that doesn't do anything but give my skin a
nice, even appearance.  LOVE IT!!!

used to be my favorite foundation, but better products are available now and Dior hasn't kept up with the competition. It's fine, but I prefer Bobbi Brown or SK-II.
